    """Run the cellsam inference pipeline on `img`.

    Cellsam is capable of segmenting a variety of cells (bacteria,
    eukaryotic, etc.) spanning all forms of microscopy (brightfield,
    phase, autofluorescence, electron microscopy) and
    staining (H&E, PAS, etc.) / multiplexed (codex, mibi, etc.)
    modalities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img : array_like with shape ``(W, H)`` or ``(W, H, C)``, where C is 1 or 3
        The image to be segmented. For multiple-channel images, `img` should
        have the following format:

          - **Stained images (e.g H&E)**: ``(W, H, C)`` where ``C == 3``
            representing color channels in RGB format.
          - **Multiplexed images**: ``(W, H, C)`` where ``C == 3`` and the
            channel ordering is: ``(blank, nuclear, membrane)``. The
            ``membrane`` channel is optional, in which case a nuclear segmentation
            is returned.
    chunks : int
        TODO: should this be an option?
    model_path : str or pathlib.Path, optional
        Path to the model weights. If `None` (the default), the latest released
        cellsam generalist model is used.

        .. note:: Downloading the model requires internet access

    bbox_threshold : float in range [0, 1], default=0.4
        Threshold for the outputs of Cellfinder, only cells with a confidence higher
        than the threshold will be included. This is the main parameter to 
        control precision/recall for CellSAM. For very out of distribution images
        use a value lower than 0.4 and vice versa.
    low_contrast_enhancement : bool, default=False
        Whether to enhance low contrast images, like Livecell images as a preprocessing
        step to improve downstream segmentation.
    swap_channels : bool, default=False
        TODO: this should be removed with loading from file
    use_wsi : bool, default=True
        Whether to use tiling to support large images, default is True.
        Generally, tiling is not required when there are fewer than ~3000
        cells in an image.
    gauge_cell_size : bool, default=False
        Wheter to perform one iteration of segmentation initially, and 
        use the results to estimate the sizes of cells and then do another
        round of segmentation using tiling parameters with these results.
    block_size : int
        Size of the tiles when `use_wsi` is `True`. In practice, should
        be in the range ``[256, 2048]``, with smaller tile sizes
        preferred for dense (i.e. many cells/FOV) images.
    overlap : int
        Tile overlap region in which label merges are considered. Must
        be smaller than `block_size`. For reliable tiling, value should
        be large enough to encompass `iou_threshold` of the extent of
        a typical object.
    iou_depth : int
        TODO: Detail effects of this parameter: is this/should this be
        distinct from overlap?
    filter_below_min : bool
        TODO: Detail this parameter - is it necessary?

    Returns
    -------
    segmentation_mask : 2D numpy.ndarray of dtype `numpy.uint32`
        A `numpy.ndarray` representing the segmentation mask for `img`.
        The array is 2D with the same dimensions as `img`, with integer
        labels representing pixels corresponding to cell instances.
        Background is denoted by ``0``.

    Examples
    --------
    Using CellSAM to segment a slice from the `~skimage.data.cells3d` dataset.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import skimage
    >>> data = skimage.data.cells3d()
    >>> data.shape
    (60, 2, 256, 256)

    From the `~skimage.data.cells3d` docstring, ``data`` is a 3D multiplexed
    image with dimensions ``(Z, C, X, Y)`` where the ordering of the channel
    dimension ``C`` is ``(membrane, nuclear)``.
    Start by extracting a 2D slice from the 3D volume. The middle slice is
    chosen arbitrarily:

    >>> img = data[30, ...]

    For multiplexed images, CellSAM expects the channel ordering to be
    ``(blank, nuclear, membrane)``:

    >>> seg = np.zeros((*img.shape[1:], 3), dtype=img.dtype)
    >>> seg[..., 1] = img[1, ...]  # nuclear channel
    >>> seg[..., 2] = img[0, ...]  # membrane channel

    Segment the image with `cellsam_pipeline`. Since this is a small image,
    we'll set ``use_wsi=False``. We'll also forgo any pre/post-processing:

    >>> mask = cellsam_pipeline(seg, use_wsi=False)
    """
    device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'

    if model_path is not None:
        modelpath = model_path
        model = get_local_model(modelpath)
        model.bbox_threshold = bbox_threshold
        model = model.to(device)
    else:
        model = None

        model = get_model(None)
        model = model.to(device)
        model.eval()
